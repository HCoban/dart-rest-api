/// [MessageBird's Balance API](https://developers.messagebird.com/api/balance/) allows you to retrieve your total balance and
/// balance information from your account, such as currency and type of payment
/// (prepaid, postpaid).
///
/// You can use the Balance API to expose this information in one of your app or
/// internal dashboards, as well as to send notifications.
///
/// The Balance API uses `HTTP verbs` and a `RESTful` endpoint structure with an
/// access key that is used as the API Authorization framework. Request and
/// response payloads are formatted as JSON—although we provide a GET
/// alternative for requests—using UTF-8 encoding and URL encoded values.
